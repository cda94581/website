		<p>The <a href="https://mcpedl.com/chunkbounds-shaders" target="_blank">ChunkBounds Resource Pack</a> shows
			chunk borders in your Minecraft Bedrock World! This is useful for many farms, as you sometimes need to chunk
			align them. I also have this constantly on his Blasting to Bedrock world, as that is how I have all the
			chunks<br>Note: As of Windows 10 1.16.200+, shaders do not work, including chunk borders</p>
