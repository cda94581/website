<h2 id="Schema" style="text-align: center;">Fogs Schema</h2>

Format: `type name // comment`<br>
If item is optional, `opt` will be placed in front.<br>
Although Minecraft is fine with it, Normal JSON does not support `// ` comments, and as such, files with them will be invalidated, and so I recommend you remove the comments.<br>
Commas are important, don't forget them. Schemas do not contain commas however, you'll need to add it yourself.<br>
Sticking with only the distance object is typically enough, and volumetric is much more advanced. I've done my best to add comments in a comprehendible way.<br>
An example is provided below using everything in the schema, as an example to help comprehend more.<br><br>
Schema

```json

Definitely did not spam my keyboard to get the random numbers, no idea where I'm getting that thought from
