			Hey, I'm cda94581, but you can call me cda!<br>
			I am a hobby YouTuber, Twitch Streamer, Minecraft Add-on Developer, and programmer. Since uploading my <a href="https://youtu.be/kxaJZWS26l8" target="_blank">first video</a> on January 20, 2020, I've had a ton
			of fun making videos and learning in the process.<br>
			I believe in 100% total transparency, meaning anything that I ever use publicly will be provided to you in a form of a link or something so you can obtain it as well.*<br>
			I make tutorials about making add-ons.<br>
			Currently, I have a running Single Player Survival series called Blasting to Bedrock, where the objective is the mine the entire world down to the bedrock layer, chunk by chunk.<br>
			I has a second channel called cda9458 2, which uploads former streams from my Twitch account, as well as some occasional content that doesn't fit with the main channel<br>
			*This means anything submitted to me, that I have used publicly, that others made will be posted. Do not submit to
			me if you do not want this

		<h1 id="friend-requests">Friend Request Policy</h1>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			I have a policy when it comes to friend requests. Anyone is free to send me friend requests, however not everyone will be accepted.<br>
			If you just send me a friend request, chances are, you'll be that group. My criteria for acceptance is simple:
			<ul>
				<li>I have had a least a few interactions with you</li>
				<li>Most/all those interactions have been positive</li>
				<li>I've enjoyed the interactions</li>
				<li>Please. Don't just interact with me.</li>
				<li>Interactions with others should be positive</li>
			</ul>
			If these criteria are met, I may accept.<br><br>
			Discord is slightly different. All the criteria above apply, however if you've tried to send me a friend request there, chances are you've noticed that I've blocked them.<br>
			Personally, I believe DMs are enough to get by, and that friend requests aren't necessary. However, if you really want it, ask me. If criteria is met, I'll open up friend requests so you can send it.
